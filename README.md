# Blawks

### My first game made for fun (Spring 2014)

*Walter Schlosser*

*Built with Java, Eclipse, and [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com) (pre-gradle)*

==================

## Description

Blawks is a game where the player places the colored pieces onto the game board to make matches of 4 or more.  Matched blocks disappear, and the larger the number matched, the more points are added.  Blawks supports 'WASD' or touch controls for movement, and the return key or touch for placement.

[libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com) allows exporting to Desktop, Android, and many other platforms.  I have included a '.jar' so that the game can be played without having to figure out all the import/settings in Eclipse at the moment.

Blawks was the first game project I decided to make after I got an [Ouya](https://www.ouya.tv) and wanted to make something I could play on it.  I enjoy making software that will run on a Desktop computer, but there is something extra cool about writing for another device like the Ouya.  The experience of working on it on my own also prepared me for working with a team on a larger Android game, [Aleksandra](https://github.com/tgco/animalBook), that I had the pleasure of making for [The Giving Child](http://thegivingchild.org).  I decided to host Blawks on GitHub since lately I have wanted to go back and refactor/build upon it.
